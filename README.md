## Getting Started

Expand your knowledge of HSK standard Chinese using interactive flashcards! This project is a combination of a React frontend and a PHP backend that provides standard APIs for fetching Chinese flashcard data and delivering flashcards to the React view for studying Chinese. Flashcards include Chinese characters, pinyin, and English translations, all of which are stored in the database.

## Features

- [x] Database for storing Chinese characters, pinyin, and English translations.
- [x] Separation between frontend and backend that communicate through standard API calls.
- [x] Following standards for a modern RESTful API
